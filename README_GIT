This is the second assignment for the Games Concepts module of my course. It is a work in progress so updates will follow shortly.

At the moment the game features:

- Semi-completed track layout with obstacles and checkpoints that need to be followed in the correct order in order to finish the race.
- Game states tracked using enums in order to better organise the flow of the game.
- Realistic (buggy) physics implementation using momentum vectors and drag.
- Hovercar health tracking with collision implementation that affects said health.

Features that I intend to add:

- Complete race track.
- Physics fixes.
- Collision resolution improvements.
- AI that controls other hovercars as part of the race.
- Different race tracks.
- Menu.


Working on this game has taught and reinforced the importance of smart time management as well as working in an organised and well-defined manner as most of the 
challenged faced during the scope of developement were centred around these matters.

From a technical standpoint, I have learnt a great deal about using STL vectors for in-game objects for dynamic storage as well as managing a relatively large codebase.
